## Presaga_core_contracts

All the smart contracts were borrowed from Gnosis and to whom we owe a lot for providing the whole DeFi community solid and very reliable smart contracts.

It's also worth noting the key changes we have made to the smart contracts in order to make them suit the needs of Presaga and its community best.
